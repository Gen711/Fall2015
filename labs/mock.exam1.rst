MOCK EXAM 1
==========================

To help you prepare for the exam practical, let's do a mock exam. These are the types of questions I will ask you during the exam. I will give you points for each section, with the idea that I have to help you get past a particular section, you lose those points, but if you can do the rest of the steps, you can still get credit for that.

This folder contains the (version 1) lab lessons for Gen711/811, released under a CC-BY license. 

This class was taught for the 1st time in Fall 2014 at the University of New Hampshire to a class of 25 (half undergrad, halF grad) with NO programming experience. We spent 2 hours per week in the computer lab doing these labs. The course website is here: http://genomebio.org/Gen711/
